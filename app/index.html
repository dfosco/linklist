        </a>

        <p>I know I've been heavy on the <i>Buzzfeed</i> bandwagon lately, but Ben Thompson's analysis is too good an opportunity to pass up. Seriously, <a href="https://twitter.com/monkbent" target="_blank">follow this guy.</a></p>
        <p>This small tidbit serves as the perfect example to his argument — overheard at a recent New York Times editorial meeting:</p>
        <blockquote class="link-description">[...] When the conversation turns to a vivid story from Liberia, where Ebola has overtaken a particular neighborhood in Monrovia, one editor proudly reports that she believes the Times is the only outlet with a reporter on the ground, which makes everyone happy until another editor says, “I think BuzzFeed actually has somebody there.” There is momentary silence.

        <blockquote class="link-description">
        <p>A bad survey won’t tell you it’s bad. It’s actually really hard to find out that a bad survey is bad — or to tell whether you have written a good or bad set of questions. [...]</p>

        <p>Most seductively, surveys yield responses that are easy to count and counting things feels so certain and objective and truthful.</p>

        <p>Even if you are counting lies.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Surveys are usually the easiest way to gather “relevant” user feedback, but it's easy to see how they can be used to cop out of <i>really</i> listening to your users.</p>

        <p>Not saying surveys are now forever banned as good practices of user research, but when Erika Hall is saying stuff like this, you tread carefully at the very least.</p>

        <h3 class="link-title">A Hint of Magic, a Bit of Science</h3>
        </a>
        <p>This week, a dress broke the internet (with the help of two llamas), yielding BuzzFeed <i class="twa twa-lg twa-zap"></i><i>28 million</i><i class="twa twa-lg twa-zap"></i> pageviews for a single article in less than 24 hours — and leaving traditional media shuffling their feet trying not to miss the tsunami.</p>

        <p>Paul Ford <a href="https://medium.com/message/yes-to-the-dress-5ec06c06aca4" target="_blank">on Medium</a> tries to understand the reasons behind the dress's success and the consequences it will bring to newsrooms around the globe:</p>

        <blockquote>I know from experience that Internet events like this have consequences. Meetings. Memos. Jealousy. Twenty-five million [at the time of publication] is a number to make an editorial director angry. [...] <i>How do I get that? They’ll wonder. How do I get that sweet, sweet traffic? Why do those children get the traffic with frolic while my attempts to go viral fall flat at hundreds of thousands of impressions?</i></blockquote>

        <p>Brian Morrissey echoes a similar feeling <a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/its-white-and-gold-dummy/" target="_blank">on Digiday</a> and proclaims that “Buzzfeed won”:</p>

        <blockquote>In this game, BuzzFeed is winning. It must boggle the mind at traditional publishers that seemingly the entire Internet is talking about content that was created not by a seasoned reporter but a “community growth manager.” These so-called premium publishing brands will inevitably lose their pricing power in the ad market as they continue to copy BuzzFeed.</blockquote>
        
        <p>With a massive audience that's becoming bigger and wider every day, solid “news” coverage, an experimental app development team and a friggin' movie studio, Buzzfeed is shaping up to be the media company of the future.</p>

        <p>Btw, <a href="https://twitter.com/cap/status/570775132697980928">they're hiring.</a></p>

        <p>Lots of insight on Apple's design process, but this quote takes the cake for <em>most amusing</em>:</p>

        <blockquote><p>Ive once sat next to J. J. Abrams at a boozy dinner party in New York, and made what Abrams recalled as “very specific” suggestions about the design of lightsabres.</p>

          <p>“I thought it would be interesting if it were less precise, and just a little bit more spitty.” A redesigned weapon could be “more analog and more primitive, and I think, in that way, somehow more ominous.”</p></blockquote>
