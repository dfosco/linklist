          <p>Later that night, I received a phone call from him, and he asked if I would be able to teach him how to code. I love teaching, and Maurice seemed like a nice kid, so I offered to help. He immediately said, “okay, go,” and awaited instruction. I explained that I wouldn’t be able to teach him over the phone, but then I found out that <b>he didn’t have internet at home</b>.</p>

        <p>It's also an impressively self-serving pat on the back, as this <i>randian-esque</i> admiration makes for a cozy narrative in which Uber investors can accomodate Travis' general douchebaggery and predatory business practices.</p>
