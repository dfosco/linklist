codekit-unbottle
===============

A scaffolding for use with [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/), heavily based on Michael Lesher's [Codekit Kickoff](https://github.com/thehive/codekit-kickoff).

Unbottle includes the Bitters scaffolding library from [Thoughtbot](http://bitters.bourbon.io/), to be used alongside Bourbon and Neat (both natively included with CodeKit). It also includes jQuery and Font-Awesome.

## Installation

You can install Codekit Unbottle by [direct download](http://github.com/dfosco/codekit-unbottle/zipball/master/) or via Bower:

`bower install codekit-unbottle`

## Documentation

Still in the works. For now, you can browse the documentation for the project that this one was based on, [CodeKit Kickoff](https://github.com/thehive/codekit-kickoff). Project usage is similar, but file tree is different.

## Acknowledgement

This project is meant to be used as a boilerplate for websites using CodeKit. It includes jQuery, Font-Awesome and Bitters (as well as @import's for Bourbon and Neat).

To that end, each of these frameworks and libraries have their own Licensing Restrictions. It is your responsibility to be aware of them.

This project is based on Michael Lesher's [Codekit Kickoff](https://github.com/thehive/codekit-kickoff).
